# Bryan Palma

## About Me 
My name is Bryan Palma and this is my third year here at UNCG as a computer science student. My hobbies consist of Drawing and gaming! Speaking of gaming, I am a part of the UNCG eSports team, specifically apart of its preimer program in which I got to essentially travel all over the eastcoast! The game that I compete in is Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. Other than that I truly love to hang out with my girlfriend cause she is just so awesome.

## My CSC340 Goals
What I truly hope to get out of this class is sort of real world applications of not only software engineering but doing that on a team as in the real world thats what i'm going to be doing. I genuinley wish UNCG provided more project base software engineering courses like this!
