## Description
> This app is a PC and Laptop building service for those who want a specific build or reccomended PCs that would fit the general need of the user. 
> The customer will have an array of options from different company brands as well as specific parts to get started from just the home page. Additionally the customer will have the option for a diy build or recommended builds. Within the diy builds the customer will then mix and match whatever parts they want in thoer laptop/desktop builds inlcluding but not limited to, specif cpu, gpu, how much ram, type of ram (DDR3, DDR4, DDR5, etc.), cooling (specific for desktop), how much storage, and more. They will have the freedom to build whatever they dream of so long as the parts are compatible with each other which the program will let the customer know. On the other side of thing, the recommended tab will ask the user a few questions in order to obtain the build that is suitable for the customers needs/wants. Think of it like a glorified filtering system.
> The customer will also be able to log in to wishlist parts as well as save the builds they want for later. They can also subscribe to the site to get newsletters of future deals or product availabilty/new hardware.
> The builders can manage the PC parts available for a build, list prebuilt PC's or laptops, and track customer's activity such as seeing what parts are commonly selected, and interacting with users reviews or any questions or inquires.
