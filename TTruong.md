# Travis Truong

## About Me
Xin Chào! My name is Travis Tú Trương. I am a Computer Science major at University of North Carolina at Greensboro that will be graduating with a Bachelors in Science in Fall 2026, hoping to either get into game development on linux along with interest working with the linux kernel. Outside of Computer Science, hobbies include playing video games (mainly genres like Japanese Role Playing Games and some Gacha games), watching shows, listening to music (big JPOP, JROCK, and KPOP listener), building computers and keyboards, and meeting with friends old and new. 

## My CSC340 Goals
I hope with CSC340, it helps me learn how to code with other people rather than relying on myself so I can work on bigger projects in the future for fun or for professional business use. I also would like to improve my knowledge of git, Github, and Gitlab in general since I see alot of projects I follow have Github or Gitlab pages.
